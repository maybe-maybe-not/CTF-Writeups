# The War of The Worlds 2 - Humans or ET?

The description for this challenge says
> Hmm, I think it may be worth taking a deeper look at this Kurt person. See if they have something to do with Lewis' disappearance. Be careful though, make sure that he doesn't know that you are investigating him.

> Maybe this "Ng Eng Siang Kurt" has a social media or something?

Looking up the username NgEngSiangKurt on username lookup, we see that the account is taken on instagram. https://www.instagram.com/NgEngSiangKurt/.

Lets look at the first post on this instagram \

We see in the search bar contains the link https://shorturl.at/krA04. It leads us to an image which contains a left half of a qr code \

Looking at the comments of the post, we see that there is an account called not_alien_123.

This account is private but the description of the profile says to find them on TikTok. On TikTok, there is only 1 [video](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSd8PLo8h/?k=1) and it seems like a normal video of a lava cake.

However there is one frame in the video which contains the right side of the qr code, cropping it we get \

Combining the qr codes together, we get \

It kinda looks like there is an amogus in the middle

Scanning the qr code, we are linked to a password protected pastebin https://pastebin.com/WW190H2W \
Going back to the original instagram account, we see that the description says
> Remember, the meaning of life is "forty-two"

Thus the password to the pastebin is forty-two

At the end of the pastebin, we see a bunch of hex
```

Decoding from hex we get
`VGhlIGh1bWFuIGFwcGVhcnMgdG8gYmUgbmFtZWQgTGV3aXMsIHN0dWR5aW5nIGF0IGEgbG9jYWwgdW5pdmVyc2l0eSBoZXJlLgoKSGUgYmVsaWV2ZSB0aGF0ICJhbGllbiIgZXhpc3RzLCBhbmQgbWF5IGhhdmUgYWxlcnRlZCBoaXMgZnJpZW5kcyBhYm91dCB1cy4KCldpbGwgbmVlZCBtb3JlIG9wZXJhdG9ycyBzZW5kIHRvIHByb3ZpZGUgZGVmZW5zZSB3aXRoIHJlZ3VsYXIgInJvdGF0aW9uIi4KCkFzIGFsd2F5cywgNDcgYW5kIEtIZGhYMkZoVEVVNVlqQmtRV00wWWxNd00ySkZTR0ppUHpCRk9XSXdVMFZqUTA0PS4=`

This is an obvious base64 string, so decoding it we get this paragraph
```
The human appears to be named Lewis, studying at a local university here.

He believe that "alien" exists, and may have alerted his friends about us.

Will need more operators send to provide defense with regular "rotation".

As always, 47 and KHdhX2FhTEU5YjBkQWM0YlMwM2JFSGJiPzBFOWIwU0VjQ04=.
```
The last line of the paragraph contains yet another base64 string and also mentions '47', thus it is likely we also need to perform rot47 after decoding it from base64. After performing this, we get the flag `WH2022{th3_5p4c3$_b3tw33n_th3_$t4r}`
