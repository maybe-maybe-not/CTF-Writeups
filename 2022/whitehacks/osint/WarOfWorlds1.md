# The War of The Worlds 1 - Shell Company

For this challenge, we were provided with a github [link](https://github.com/CTFSolverService) to an organisation. The challenge asks us to find the owner of the organisation with the flag WH2022{FullNameWithNoSpaceAndInitialCaps}. The description of the organisation says:

> We solve CTF for you, so you don't have to <3. Secure your communication and contact us via key 0xBA28DC8862A8272A.

Searching the key on https://pgp.mit.edu/ we get the owner of the organisation being Ng Eng Siang Kurt, thus the flag is WH2022{NgEngSiangKurt}.
