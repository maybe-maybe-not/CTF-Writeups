# OnlyCats

## Problem Statement
> APOCALYPSE has recently started a new business venture, a [website](http://chals.cyberthon22f.ctf.sg:40501/) for people to download cute images of cats! While that seems like a relatively normal kind of business, our intel says that it might be more than what it appears to be. So we've got to keep a close eye on it. Currently, their service has only cat pictures.
